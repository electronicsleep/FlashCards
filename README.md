FlashCard application for learning python and memorizing simple math

Author: Chris Robertson

License: Released under the MIT license

Purpose: A simple flashcard application for anyone, particularly college and high school students to learn programming and math and can be used to record anything. Think of it like a assoitave memory array program. I got the idea for this program to keep my mind sharp for interviews and I wanted to remember facts I have to look up often with a goal of being a better programmer. I left the application as simple as possible so that students can extend the functionality without too much complexity. This is the open source version, there is a web version.

* Modify the CreateMemFile.py to generate your own cards
* Remember last 3 cards to prevent duplicates
* GUI interface for the cards using wxwidgets
* C++ version, Perl version, Bash version
* Loop in the main program with quit
* Stats on answered questions, time, topscore
* Save stats file save and load for future use
* Compete with others locally or on the net
* Website to post top scores via an API call
* iPhone version, Android version
