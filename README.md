Purpose: A simple flashcard application for anyone, particularly college and high school students to learn programming and math. I used this program in interviews to remember facts I always have to look up with a goal of being a better programmer. I left the application as simple as possible so that students can extend the functionality without too much complexity. This is the open source version, there is a web version.

* Modify the CreateMemFile.py to generate your own cards
* Remember last 3 cards to prevent duplicates
* GUI interface for the cards
* Loop in the main program with quit
* Stats on answered questions, time, topscore
* Save stats file save and load for future use
