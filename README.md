Purpose: A simple flashcard application for anyone to memorize programming and math. I got the idea for this program to keep my mind sharp and wanted to remember facts I have to look up often with a goal of being a better programmer. I left the application as simple as possible so that anyone can extend the functionality without too much complexity. This is the open source version, there is a web version. 

Usage:
```
Open Terminal
git clone https://github.com/electronicsleep/FlashCards.git
cd FlashCards
python FlashCards.py User
```
